This is a Scheme-to-Python translator supporting functions, conditionals, variables, and basic operators. Part of a class project but I spent more than
30 hours creating all of it. I think it's pretty cool; you can either write Scheme sytax in a text file or feed it directly to the functions and it should
convert it to Python syntax before evaluating.
